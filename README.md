# Jobs API
This application keeps track of the jobs you've applied to during your job search.

This application was built using Node.js on the backend and React on the frontend. I did not design or develop the frontend. I developed the backend following a tutorial by <a href="https://www.johnsmilga.com/">John Smilga</a>.
